# Doing Forensics on Myself: My Phone

*July 2024*

***

I recently did a logical acquisition of my phone in order to learn more about mobile forensics and get my feet wet in practicing DFIR.

I first started out by searching on Google how to take a forensic image of my phone. I stumbled upon a [discussion](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/55058/mount-iphone-for-forensic-analysis-or-take-forensic-image) on the information Stack Exchange and a [blog post](https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2021/03/breaking-the-iphone-12-forensic-extraction-of-ios-14-devices/) from ElcomSoft. I also listened to various episodes of the [CyberWork](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/podcast/) podcast, where a guest speaker recommended using iTunes backup to perform a logical acquisition.

TODO.

Encrypted iPhone backup with a known password is a very common methodology (more information if encrypted! Digital forensics careers: fact vs fiction)
