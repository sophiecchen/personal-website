# 2.4 Linux Command Line Tutorial

***

## Introduction to Linux

Linux is a family of related operating systems. Linux is powerful, flexible, and free, and it supports many file systems. However, it has a steep learning curve. 

Linux is a VFS: everything in Linux is a file. In other words, everything in the system, from processes to directories to sockets, is represented by a file descriptor, or inode, which is how the operating system recognizes files. Even devices are represented by file-like objects, and they can be found under `/dev`.

An inode is the unique number or ID of a file and the data structure of a file. Users store data in files, and the operating system stores metadata about the file in an inode. The inode points to the content of a file and can be accessed by the file name. 

We can view the inodes of files using `ls -ia` command. The `-i` option prints the inode.

## Navigating Linux 

### Printing Information

The present working directory is the directory we are current in. We can view the present working directory with `pwd`:

We can use the `ls` command to list the files and directories that exist in a directory.

By adding the `` flag, we can TODO.

The `tree` command TODO.

### Paths
Linux commands are also files. For example, the `ls` command is stored at `/bin/ls`. However, we can execute `ls` in any folder. This is because of paths.

A path is a hierarchical representation of the location, or address, of a file or directory within the file system's structure. TODO.
