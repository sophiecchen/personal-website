# Security and DFIR Resources

***

## Security Fundamentals

Building a basic understanding of how computers work as well and learning common security terminology and concepts is crucial for diving deeper into security. I've found these resources helpful for building a strong foundation.

* [Professor Messer's Security+ Videos](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-701/sy0-701-video/sy0-701-comptia-security-plus-course/) explain a wide variety of fundamental cybersecurity concepts. These videos are geared toward the CompTIA Security+ Certification.
* [Hack The Box](https://hackthebox.com/) provides CTF-style machines for all levels to hack into.
* [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) allows users to practice skills in a CTF-style room.

## DFIR Courses and Labs

Once you have a basic understanding of cybersecurity, I recommend looking into a subfield that you find interesting. I personally am interested in DFIR, and these courses and labs are helpful for getting hands-on experience.

* [Digital Forensics Lab](https://github.com/frankwxu/digital-forensics-lab) teaches users the fundamentals of digital forensics through labs and case studies.
* [Hexordia](https://learn.hexordia.com/) teaches multiple courses on digital forensics, with a focus on mobile forensics.
* [13Cubed](https://training.13cubed.com/) teaches a broad range of digital forensics courses, from Windows forensics to malware analysis.
* [Cyber5W](https://cyber5w.com/) teaches multiple courses on digital forensics fundamentals, with labs included.
* [Malware Unicorn](https://malwareunicorn.org/) provides reverse-engineering workshops.
* [DFIR Diva](https://dfirdiva.com/) includes free resources, training recommendations, and blogs about DFIR. 
* [DFIR Training](https://www.dfir.training/) keeps track of upcoming trainings in DFIR.

## Journals and Blogs

Since technology evolves rapidly, keeping up with the the latest research in security is a necessity.

* [IEEE Security & Privacy](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/sp) is a top security journal for researchers in all domains of security.
* [Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/forensic-science-international-digital-investigation) includes research relating to crime and security, with a focus on digital evidence and multimedia.

## Podcasts

Podcasts are a useful for integrating cybersecurity into your daily routine.

* [Cyberwire Daily](https://thecyberwire.com/podcasts/daily-podcast) provides daily cybersecurity news and analysis geared at professionals.
* [CyberWork](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/podcast/) invites industry leaders to discuss cybersecurity careers and skills needed to join the field.
* [Digital Forensics Now](https://digitalforensicsnow.buzzsprout.com/) discusses the latest news in digital forensics from a law enforcement perspective.

## Free Tools

These DFIR tools are free to use and commonly used in the field.

* [Eric Zimmerman's Tools](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md) include multiple tools useful for a variety of tasks relevant to digital forensics.
* [LEAPP Projects](https://github.com/abrignoni?tab=repositories) include parsers for many types of artifacts and logs.
* [Autopsy](https://www.autopsy.com/) is an end-to-end digital forensics platform.
* [FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/digital-forensics-software/ftk-imager) is a popular Windows image acquisition tool.
* [Volatility](https://volatilityfoundation.org/) is a memory forensics framework for incident response and malware analysis.
* [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is a popular network protocol analyzer.

## Other Resources

These are other resources that I personally find helpful.

* [Security Certification Roadmap](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/) contains common certifications for different points of your career in different security subfields.
* [Digital Forensics Images](https://cfreds.nist.gov/all) includes many device images that you can download and practice on.
* [This Week in 4n6](https://thisweekin4n6.com/) compiles the most relevant digital forensics and cyber threat intelligence articles and sends them to your inbox.

SANS has compiled a [list of free tools](https://www.sans.org/img/free-faculty-tools.pdf) used in nearly every area of cybersecurity. You can also find an extensive list of cybersecurity resources (tools and learning material) on Hack-with-Github's [Awesome Hacking](https://github.com/Hack-with-Github/Awesome-Hacking) repository.
