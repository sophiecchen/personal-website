# TryHackMe Walkthroughs

#### TryHackMe is challenge-based, so I _highly_ recommend you trying the problems yourself first.

[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) is a popular platform for beginners in cybersecurity to learn and practice their skills. TryHackMe emphasizes bite-sized, gamified lessons (called rooms). These rooms can be guided (geared toward teaching you a new concept) or practice (geared toward reinforcing your skills). TryHackMe requires no setup, and its rooms-focused approach helped me integrate learning a bit of cybersecurity into my daily routine.
