# Sakura Room

[TryHackMe Walkthroughs](./) ⋅ [Practice](../) ⋅ Sakura Room

## Task 1: INTRODUCTION

This room will have us practicing a wide variety of passive OSINT techniques through an sample investigation aimed at catching a cybercriminal.

## Task 2: TIP-OFF

The OSINT Dojo recently found themselves the victim of a cyber attack. An image left behind by the cybercriminals can be viewed [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OsintDojo/public/3f178408909bc1aae7ea2f51126984a8813b0901/sakurapwnedletter.svg).

My first instinct upon seeing the image was to decode the binary in the background of the file. However, the instructions in this step indicated that looking at the metadata would be most useful. Planning to put this image into an online EXIF viewer tool, I attempted to download the file. When I noticed that the file was an svg, I decided to view the XML of the image instead by pressing `CTRL+U` in my browser instead. The XML contained the metadata I was looking for.

<details>
<summary>What username does the attacker go by?</summary>

SakuraSnowAngelAiko

The filename of the image is `/home/SakuraSnowAngelAiko/Desktop/pwnedletter.png`, as shown in the source code viewer. Thus, SakuraSnowAngelAiko is the attacker's username.
