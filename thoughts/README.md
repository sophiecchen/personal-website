# My Favorite Free Cybersecurity Resources

When first started learning cybersecurity, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of resources online. In the hopes that this will help you be less overwhelmed, I've compiled a small list of resources, geared toward beginners, that I've ended up using and have found helpful.

## Informational

Building a basic understanding of how computers work as well and learning common security terminology and concepts is crucial for diving deeper into security. I've found these resources helpful for building a strong foundation.

* [Hack The Box Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) teaches beginners cybersecurity topics with a focus on penetration testing.
* [TryHackMe Guided Rooms](https://tryhackme.com/r/hacktivities) guide beginners through various areas of cybersecurity.
* [Professor Messer's Security+ Videos](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-701/sy0-701-video/sy0-701-comptia-security-plus-course/) explain a wide variety of fundamental cybersecurity concepts. These videos are geared toward the CompTIA Security+ Certification.

## CTFs and Labs

Once you have a basic understanding of cybersecurity, I recommend using labs to get hands-on experience.

* [Digital Forensics Lab](https://github.com/frankwxu/digital-forensics-lab) teaches users the fundamentals of digital forensics through labs and case studies.
* [SEED Labs 2.0](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/)
* [OWASP Bricks](https://sechow.com/bricks/index.html) 
* [Hack The Box Lab](https://hackthebox.com/) 
* [TryHackMe Practice Rooms](https://tryhackme.com/r/hacktivities/practice)

## Events

SANS Cybersecurity Summits are free to attend online. They are a great way to get connected to the cybersecurity community.

If you are interested in digital forensics like me, Magnet Forensics holds a yearly virtual summit that is free to attend. [Replays of the talks](https://www.magnetforensics.com/magnet-virtual-summit-2024-replays/) for 2024 are now available online.

## Podcasts

Podcasts are a useful for integrating cybersecurity into your daily routine.

* [DFIRL](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/introduction-to-digital-forensics-in-real-life-dfirl-podcast/) discusses real-life cases in which digital evidence (uncovered by digital forensics) has played a pivotal role.
* [Technology Pill](https://privacyinternational.org/learning-resources/technology-pill-podcast) discusses the changing role of technology in society and the way it impacts people around the world.
* [Malicious Life](https://malicious.life/) shares the stories of some of the wildest hacks in history.

## Research and Reports

I've personally found reading cybersecurity research very rewarding. Dr. Srinivasan Keshav's [How To Read a Research Paper](http://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/papers/07/paper-reading.pdf) explains how to read research in a clear and concise way.

Google Scholar is a great tool for finding interesting papers by keyword. If you've found a paper you like, you can find similar papers through the related work and reference sections of the paper. Google Scholar also lists other papers that cite a paper.

Here are some of my personal recommendations for those who have never read a research paper before. These papers are approachable, speak to both computing and society. Reading these will help familiarize you with how papers in computing tend to be structured.

* ["A Stalker’s Paradise": How Intimate Partner Abusers Exploit Technology](https://rist.tech.cornell.edu/papers/stalkers-paradise-intimate.pdf) by Diana Freed, Jackeline Palmer, Diana Minchala, Karen Levy, Thomas Ristenpart, and Nicola Dell (2018)
* [Investigating Large Scale HTTPS Interception in Kazakhstan](https://ensa.fi/papers/HTTPSKaz.pdf) by Ram Sundara Raman, Leonid Evdokimov, Eric Wurstrow, J. Alex Halderman, and Roya Ensafi (2020)
* [Throttling Twitter: An Emerging Censorship Technique in Russia](https://ensa.fi/papers/throttling-imc-paper.pdf) by by Diwen Xue, Reethika Ramesh, ValdikSS, Leonid Evdokimov, Andrey Viktorov, Arham Jain, Eric Wustrow, Simone Basso, and Roya Ensafi (2021)
* [The Antrim County 2020 Election Incident: An Independent Forensic Investigation](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22-halderman.pdf) by J. Alex Halderman (8/2022)
