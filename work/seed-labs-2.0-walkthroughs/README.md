# SEED Labs 2.0 Walkthroughs

#### These labs are challenge-based, so I _highly_ recommend you trying the problems yourself first.

[SEED Labs 2.0](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs\_20.04/) is a product of the SEED project, which aims to provide hands-on labs for cybersecurity education. These labs are guided, and I have found them very helpful in exposing me to the different areas of cybersecurity in a fun and interactive manner.
