# 2.4 Linux Command Line Tutorial

## Introduction to OS and File Systems

An operating system is a type of system software that manages hardware and software resources on a computer. Common features of operating systems include:
* Process management
* Memory management
* File system
* Device drivers
* Networking
* Security
* Input-output (I/O)

The file system feature is especially relevant to digital forensics. A file is a collection of correlated information. This information is recorded on secondary or non-volatile storage like magnetic disks, optical disks, and tapes. A file system  defines how files are named, stored, and retrieved from a storage device. File systems allow users to interact with information stored on a computer in a more TODO manner.

File systems are common represented as TODO.
