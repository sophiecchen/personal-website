# Virtual Memory Pager

This virtual memory pager, written in C++, is capable of managing multiple processes through the lifecycle of creation, forking and destruction. It supports swap-backed and file-backed page and manages page faults for reading and writing.

*This project was completed for my operating systems class and is stored in a private GitHub as per my university's honor code. If you are a involved in recruitment or hiring and would like to see the code for this project, please contact me.*
