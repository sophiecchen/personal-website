# My Favorite Free Cybersecurity Resources

When first started learning cybersecurity, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of resources online. In the hopes that this will help you be less overwhelmed, I've compiled a small list of resources, geared toward beginners, that I've ended up using and have found helpful.

## Informational

Building a basic understanding of how computers work as well as what common security terminology and concepts are TODO. These resources TODO.

* [Hack The Box Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) teaches beginners cybersecurity topics with a focus on penetration testing.
* TryHackMe Guided Rooms
* [Professor Messer's Security+ Videos](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-701/sy0-701-video/sy0-701-comptia-security-plus-course/) explain a wide variety of fundamental cybersecurity concepts. These videos are geared toward the CompTIA Security+ Certification.

## CTFs and Labs

Once you have a basic understanding, TODO.

* [Digital Forensics Lab](https://github.com/frankwxu/digital-forensics-lab) teaches users the fundamentals of digital forensics through labs and case studies
* SEED Labs 2.0
* OWASP Bricks
* Hack The Box Lab
* TryHackMe Practice Rooms

## Events

SANS Cybersecurity Summits TODO.&#x20;

If you are interested in digital forensics like me, Magnet Forensics holds a yearly virtual summit that is free to attend. You can also view TODO.

## Podcasts

Podcasts are a TODO.

* [DFIRL](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/introduction-to-digital-forensics-in-real-life-dfirl-podcast/): discusses real-life cases in which digital evidence (uncovered by digital forensics) has played a pivotal role
* [Technology Pill](https://privacyinternational.org/learning-resources/technology-pill-podcast): discusses the changing role of technology in society and the way it impacts people around the world (including you!)
* [Malicious Life](https://malicious.life/): shares the stories of some of the wildest hacks in history

## More Resources

SANS list and also github repo. SANS also has a TODO of the most common tools used in different cybersecurity areas.
