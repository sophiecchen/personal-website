# Reading Research Papers as an Undergraduate

## The Benefits of Reading a Research Paper

## Reading a Research Paper

Dr. Srinivasan Keshav's [How To Read a Research Paper](http://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/papers/07/paper-reading.pdf) TODO. Instead, TODO.

## Finding Interesting Papers

I personally like to also TODOO.

## Beginner-Friendly Papers

If you've never read a research paper, here are some of my recommendations. These papers are approachable, speak to both computing and society. Reading these will help familiarize you with how papers in computing tend to be structured.
