# Digital Forensics Lab Walkthrough

Learning digital forensics with [Weifeng Xu, Lin Deng, and Dianxiang Xu's Digital Forensics Lab](https://github.com/frankwxu/digital-forensics-lab) has been one of my most anticipated projects, so I'm very excited to share my experience with this lab.

My goal for this walkthrough is to provide a sort of informal textbook version of the PowerPoints provided in the GitHub and to document any troubleshooting I had to do. I hope that this walkthrough can be of use for other students who are reviewing the lab content or learning digital forensics by themselves.

*This is a work in progress.*
